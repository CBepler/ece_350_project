# ALU
## Name
Christian Bepler

## Description of Design

I have each bit of functionality stored in its own file. The ALU then uses those modules along with a multiplexer to select the correct output. 
Overflow is also handled by a multiplexer, there are 32 bit helper wires because the multiplexer uses 32 bit outputs.

## Bugs

No known bugs.
